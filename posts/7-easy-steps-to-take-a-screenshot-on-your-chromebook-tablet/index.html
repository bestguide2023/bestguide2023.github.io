All you need to do is press the power and volume down buttons at the same time for two seconds. This will take the screenshot and you can find the screenshot in your Downloads folder. To crop the screenshot, just open it with an image editor, such as the default Gallery app, and choose the crop option. Finally, save the cropped screenshot and you’re done. This feature makes it easy to share only the part of the screen that you need instead of the entire screen.</p><h3 id=1-launch-the-screenshot-tool>1. Launch the Screenshot Tool<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-launch-the-screenshot-tool>#</a></h3><p>Taking a partial screenshot on a Chromebook tablet is easy and convenient. All you need to do is press the power button and volume up button at the same time. You&rsquo;ll then see a notification letting you know that a screenshot has been taken. When you&rsquo;re done taking the screenshot, you can release the buttons and you&rsquo;ll find the screenshot in the &lsquo;Downloads&rsquo; folder of your Chromebook. To capture a portion of your screen, you can use the &lsquo;Select region&rsquo; option as you take the screenshot. This will allow you to select a specific area of your screen that you&rsquo;d like to screenshot. Finally, you can save the screenshot to your desired location.</p><h3 id=2-capture-the-desired-portion-of-the-screen>2. Capture the Desired Portion of the Screen<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-capture-the-desired-portion-of-the-screen>#</a></h3><p>Taking a partial screenshot can be tricky sometimes. Chromebook tablets provide less options than a computer, but it can be done. Begin by pressing the power and volume down buttons at the same time for two full seconds. The screenshot will appear in the notification bar at the bottom of the screen. Drag the notification bar upwards and find the screenshot. It will be labeled with the date and time it was taken. You can also tap the edit button to crop the image before saving it. The screenshot is now saved to your image file.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQBtwNhIMzE style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
