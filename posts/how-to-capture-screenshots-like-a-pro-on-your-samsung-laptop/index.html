Using the built-in screenshot tool, you can quickly and easily capture your screen in various ways, including a full-screen capture or a portion of the screen. Once you have the image, it’s time to optimize it for better results. Here are some pro tips:</p><p>Choose the right resolution. By default, screenshots are taken at 72 dpi, which is not ideal for digital media as this low resolution will make the image look pixelated. To increase the quality, change the resolution to 300 dpi.</p><p>Adjust the brightness and contrast. Adjusting the brightness and contrast of your screenshot will make it look more vibrant – and this can be done quickly and easily with an image editor.</p><p>Add a border. Adding a border to your screenshot can make it stand out from the crowd. Use a simple, yet eye-catching border, like a bright color to draw attention to your image.</p><p>Save in the correct format. Screenshots are usually saved as JPEG, PNG or TIFF. JPEGs are the smallest in terms of file size, but if you need a higher quality image, use PNG or TIFF instead.</p><h3 id=1-preparing-your-laptop-for-screenshot-capturing>1.
