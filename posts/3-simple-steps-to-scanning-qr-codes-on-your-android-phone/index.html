If not, there are lots of free scanning apps available on the Google Play Store. Once you&rsquo;ve installed your scanning app, open it and point your device&rsquo;s camera at the QR code. The QR code should be automatically scanned and the content will be displayed. Make sure that your camera is properly focused on the QR code for the best results. If the QR code is too small, you can pinch to zoom in. After the QR code is scanned, you can follow the instructions provided. Finally, always make sure the link you are accessing is from a secure source. By following these steps, you can easily scan QR codes on your Android phone.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjHZfW5orOU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How do you scan QR codes on an Android phone?
