Factory Resetting Android Phone from PC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-factory-resetting-android-phone-from-pc>#</a></h2><p>Factory resetting an Android phone from a PC can be an extremely convenient way to start fresh and delete all your old data. Fortunately, the process is much easier than most people think. First, you will need to install a program called Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on your PC. Make sure you download the latest version of ADB available. Once the installation is complete, connect your phone to the computer with a USB cable. Then, open the ADB program and type adb devices into the command line. This will list all the devices connected to the PC. Finally, type adb reboot recovery and wait for your phone to restart. You will now have the option to factory reset your Android phone with the help of your PC.</p><h3 id=1-install-android-debug-bridge-adb>1. Install Android Debug Bridge (ADB)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-install-android-debug-bridge-adb>#</a></h3><p>Factory resetting your Android Phone from a PC is a great way to erase all your data without having to go through any tedious resetting processes. To do it, you&rsquo;ll need a USB cable to connect your phone and PC. After connecting both devices, you&rsquo;ll need to access the Recovery Mode from your Android Phone. This can be done by pressing and holding the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Once the Recovery Mode menu appears, you&rsquo;ll need to choose the Wipe data/factory reset option. After choosing this, the resetting process will start. Once it&rsquo;s completed, your phone will be reset and you can disconnect it from PC.</p><h3 id=2-resetting-android-phone-with-adb>2. Resetting Android Phone with ADB<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-resetting-android-phone-with-adb>#</a></h3><p>The process of factory resetting your Android phone from a PC is relatively easy. The first step is to install a free program such as Minimal ADB and Fastboot on your PC. This will allow you to control your Android phone from the PC. Once installed, connect your phone to the PC and open the program. Once opened, type in the command “adb reboot recovery” and press enter. This will boot your phone into the recovery mode. Once in this mode, select the option “factory reset”. After doing this, your phone will begin the process of factory resetting itself. It may take a few minutes for the reset to finish but once it is done, your phone should be returned to its original state.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RGZ1i5MpWCw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How do I factory reset my Android phone from my PC?

However, if you have any paid apps, you may need to repurchase them after the reset.</p><p>Q4: How do I reinstall my apps after a factory reset?
A4: After a factory reset, you can reinstall apps from the Google Play Store by searching for them. Alternatively, you can access your Google Play Store account and click on the “My Apps” option to view all of your previously purchased apps.
