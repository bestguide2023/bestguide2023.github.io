This product has become popular among many headphone users due to its sleek design, superior sound quality and the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t require a cable to work. However, users may be wondering how to check the battery level on their Beats Battery when they need to. Fortunately, it is actually quite easy to do so with any Android device.</p><p>First, users will need to download the Beats app from the Google Play Store. Once the app is installed, users will need to press the power button on their Beats Battery for a couple of seconds. This will cause the device to display its charge level in the app. In addition, there will be a battery icon at the top of the app, which will also indicate the battery level.</p><p>Those who are using an earlier version of Android can also check the Beats Battery level, but they will need to go into their device settings and look for the Bluetooth menu. In this menu, they should look for the Connected Devices option, and then tap on the Beats Battery device. This will cause the device to display its battery level.</p><p>Finally, users can also check the battery level of their Beats Battery by pressing the power button once. This will cause the device to emit a pulse of light which will indicate the level of battery in it. This method, however, is not the most accurate way to check the battery level of the Beats Battery, and so users are encouraged to use the Beats app or their device settings instead.</p><h2 id=2-step-by-step-guide-to-check-android-phones-battery-health-with-beats>2.
