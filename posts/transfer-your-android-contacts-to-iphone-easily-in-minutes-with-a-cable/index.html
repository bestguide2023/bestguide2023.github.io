With just a few steps, you can keep your contact list up to date without any hassle. Here are some of the key benefits of using a cable to transfer contacts.</p><p>First, it is a lot faster than other methods. Transferring contacts using a cable doesn&rsquo;t require any complex setup or require you to use any third-party software. As a result, you can transfer contacts from Android to iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Second, it&rsquo;s a lot more secure than using cloud or other online services. When transferring contacts, you&rsquo;re not sending them to an external server, making the entire process much more secure.</p><p>Third, transfers are exact copies of your contacts. When using a cable to transfer contacts, you can be sure that the contacts will be exactly the same on both the Android and iPhone device. This eliminates the need to manually input numbers or other details after the transfer.</p><p>Finally, it&rsquo;s a lot more convenient than other methods. You don&rsquo;t need to use any third-party services or set up an online account. All you have to do is plug in the cable and you&rsquo;re ready to go.</p><h2 id=3-summary-of-the-process-and-necessary-tools-needed>3.
