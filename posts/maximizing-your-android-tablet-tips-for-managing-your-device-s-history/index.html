This will help you identify any unusual activity, such as apps that are running in the background or services that are using data. You can also monitor battery and memory usage as well as storage space and delete any apps that are taking up a lot of resources.\nSecondly, make sure you’re regularly backing up your device. This way, you can restore it to a previous state if anything goes wrong.

For example, you can install a browser security plugin that will prevent your device from collecting data without your permission. As an added bonus, the plugin will also provide you with enhanced security as you browse the web.\nFinally, it is important to ensure that you always back up your device. This will help you to recreate your history if something goes wrong and ensures that you will not lose any important data.

If you regularly use your tablet’s browser, make sure to clear the browsing data on a regular basis. This will help reduce lag and free up storage space.
